The objectives of my game are to hit the other player 10 times before they hit you 10 times
The right player is the Gunman
The left player is a Zombie
Both players can run, jump, and hit eachother
When a player dies, a victory screen will reappear
After 5 seconds, the game will reset and the score counter will increase for the player that won
The controls for the gunman are AWSD for movement and RT for fighting
The controls for the zombie are the arrow keys for movement and NM for fighting

Sources that I used to help me with my code include ChatGPT, Coding with Russ (https://youtu.be/s5bd9KMSSW4?si=3cuYSQa0tRtluH8y), and Clear Code.
